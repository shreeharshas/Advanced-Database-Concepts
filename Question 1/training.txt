Training in a Baksetball Camp

Consider the following RDB schema of a basketball development league:
Players (pid, name, height, age, university, ARP(Average Rating Points))
Camps (cid, name, credit)
Take (pid, cid, season, year, rating)
The ratings will be letters, e.g. A+, A, ...
RatingPoints (rating, points)
This table maps a letter rating to a point in the scale of 0-10. For example, (A-, 8.7) is a tuple in it.
RequiredCamps (university, cid)
This table records the required camps a player must take before being drafted by NBA / WNBA.
Squad (qid, cid, season, practice, rating)
InSquad (qid, pid)
Write queries in SQL as required and note that you will be graded based on whether your queries are
correct and simple.
1. Find the players who come from the same university, and have taken the same camp and are in the
same squad with a player named ‘Karl-Anthony Towns Jr.’. Return the name, height, and ARP of
these players.
2. Find the players who have never taken any camps that are not required by his/her university.
3. A player can head for the draft from his/her university if he/she has taken camps of a total number
of 90 credits or more, with an ARP > 5.0, and has taken all required camps. Please find the pid and
name of the players who can go to the draft.
